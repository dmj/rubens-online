                    <pb facs="00013"/> To my Reader.</head>
                <p> I Am not ignorant (Iudicious Reader) how many peeces of the most curious Masters
                    haue beene vttered to the world of this Subiect, as Plutarch, Erasmus, Viues,
                    Sadolet, Sturmius, Osorius, Sir Thomas Eliot, M. Askham, with sundry others; so
                    that my small Taper among so many Torches, were as good out, as seeming to giue
                    no light at all. I confesse it true. But as rare and curious stamps vpon Coynes,
                    for their varietie and strangeneße, are daily enquired after, and bought vp,
                    though the Siluer be all one and common with ours: so fares it with Bookes,
                    which (as Meddailes) beare the Pictures and deuices of our varius Inuention,
                    though the matter be the same, yet for varietie sake they shall bee read, yea
                    (and as the same dishes drest after a new fashion) perhaps please the tastes of
                    many better. But this regard neither mooued me. When I was beyond the Seas, and
                    in a part of France, adioyning vpon Artoise, I was inuited oftentimes to the
                    house of a Noble personage, who was both a great Souldier<pb facs="00014"/>and
                    an excellent Scholler; and one day aboue the rest, as wee sate in an open and
                    goodly Gallerie at dinner, a young English Gentleman, who desirous to trauaile,
                    had beene in Italy, and many other places, fortuned to come to his house; and
                    (not so well furnished for his returne home as was fitting) desired
                    entertainement into his seruice. My Lord, who could speake as little English, as
                    my Countrey-man French, bad him welcome, and demaunded by me of him, what hee
                    could doe: For I keepe none (quoth he) but such as are commended for some good
                    qualitie or other, and I giue them good allowance; some an hundred, some sixtie,
                    some fiftie Crownes by the yeare: and calling some about him, (very Gentleman
                    like, as well in their behauiour, as apparell) This (saith hee) rideth and
                    breaketh my great Horses; this is an excellent Lutenist, this a good Painter and
                    Surueyer of land, this a passing Linguist and Scoller, who instructeth my
                    Sonnes, &amp;c. Sir (quoth this young man) I am a Gentleman borne, and can
                    onely attend you in your Chamber, or waite vpon your Lordship abroad. See (quoth
                    Monsieur de Ligny, for so was his name) how your Gentry of England are bred:
                    that when they are distressed, or want meanes in a strange Countrey, they are
                    brought vp neither to any quality to preferre them, nor haue they so much as the
                    Latine tongue to helpe themselues withall. I knew it generally to be true, but
                    for the time, and vpon occasion excused it as I could; yet he was receiued, and
                    after returned to his friends in good fashion. Hereby I onely giue to know, that
                    there is nothing more deplorable, then the breeding in generall of our Gentle<pb
                        facs="00015"/>men, none any more miserable then one of them, if he fall into
                    misery in a strange Country. Which I can impute to no other thing, then the
                    remisnesse of Parents, and negligence of Masters in their youth. Wherefore at my
                    comming ouer, considering the great forwardnesse and proficience of children in
                    other Countries, the backwardnesse and rawnesse of ours; the industry of Masters
                    there, the ignorance and idlenesse of most of ours; the exceeding care of
                    Parents in their childrens Education, the negligence of ours: Being taken
                    through change of ayre with a Quartane Feuer, that leasure I bad <gap
                        reason="omitted"/> as I may truly say, by fits I employed vpon this
                    Discourse for the priuate vse of a Noble young Gentleman my friend, not
                    intending it should euer see light, as you may perceiue by the plaine and
                    shallow current of the Discourse, fitted to a young and tender capacitie.
                    Howsoeuer I haue done it, and if thou shalt find herein any thing that may
                    content, at the least, not distaste thee, I shall be glad and encouraged to a
                    more serious Peece: if neither, but out of a malignant humour, disdaine what I
                    haue done, I care not; I haue pleased my selfe: and long since learned, Enuie,
                    together with her Sister ignorance, to harbour onely in the basest and most
                    degenerate breast. <pb facs="00016"/></p>

                <p> If we consider arightly the Frame of the whole Vniuerse and Method of the
                    all-excellent Wisedome in her worke; as creating the formes of things infinitely
                    diuers, so according to Dignity of Essence or Vertue in effect, we must
                    acknowledge the same to hold a Soueraigntie, and transcendent praedominance, as
                    well of Rule as Place each ouer either. Among the heauenly bodies wee see he
                    Nobler Orbes, and of greatest influence to be raised aloft, the lesse
                    effectuall, depressed. Of Elements, the Fire the most pure and operatiue to hold
                    the highest place; in compounded bodies, of things as well sensible as
                    insensible, there runneth a veine of Excellence proceeding from the Forme,
                    ennobling (in the same kind) some other aboue the rest. <note

                    Among Flowers, wee<pb facs="00018" n="2"/>most admire and esteeme the Rose:
                    Among Fruite, the Pom-roy and Queene-apple: among Stones, we value aboue all the
                    Diamond; Mettals, Gold and Siluer: and since weknew these to transferre their
                    inward excellence and vertues to their Species successiuely, shall wee not
                    acknowledge a Nobilitie in Man of greater perfection, of Nobler forme, and
                    Prince of these? </p>
                <p>Can we bee curious in discerning a counterfait from the true Pearle; to choose
                    our siens of the best fruit, buy our Flowers at twenty pounds the roote or flip:
                    and not regard or make difference of linage, nor be carefull into what Stocke we
                    match our selues, or of what parents we choose a Seruant? </p>
                <p>Surely, to beleeue that Nature (rather the God of Nature) produceth not the same
                    among our selues, is to question the rarest Worke-mistris of ignorance or
                    Partialitie, <note place="margin-left">Nobilitie defined.</note> and to abuse
                    our selues beneath the Beast. Nobilitie then (taken in the generall sence) is
                    nothing else then a certaine eminency, or notice taken of some one aboue the
                    rest, for some notable act performed, bee it good or ill; and in that senceare
                    Nobilis and Ignobilis vsually among the Latine Poets taken. More particularly,
                    and in the genuine sence, Nobilitie is the Honour of blood in a Race or Linage,
                    conferredformerly vpon some one or more of that Family, either by the Prince,
                    the Lawes, customes of that Land or Place, whereby either out of knowledge,
                    culture of the minde, or by some glorious Action performed, they haue beene
                    vsefull and beneficiall to the Common-wealths and places where they liue. </p>
                <p>For since all Vertue consisteth in Action, and no man is borne for himselfe, wee
                    adde, beneficiall and vsefull to his Country, for hardly they are to be admitted
                    for Noble, who (though of neuer so excellent parts) consume their light, as in a
                    darke Lanthorne in contemplation, and a Stoicallretirednesse. </p>
                <p><pb facs="00019" n="3"/> And since Honor is the reward of Vertue and glorious
                    Action onely, Vice and Basenesse must not expect her fauours: as the people of
                    Rome created C. Flauius from a Tribune, Senator and AEdile for stealing of a
                    booke of Records. Euthicrates, Euphorbas, and Phylagrus, were ennobled for
                    Treason: and Cottier by Lewis the eleuenth, the French King, vnworthily aduanced
                    from a mender of Stockings, to be Lord Chancellor of France. </p>
                <p>Neither must we Honor or esteeme those ennobled, or made Gentle in blood, who by
                    Mechanicke and base meanes, haue raked vpa malle of wealth, or because they
                    follow some great man, weare the Cloath of a Noble Personage, or haue purchased
                    an ill Coat at a good rate; no more then a Player vpon the Stage, for wearing a
                    Lords cast suit: since Nobilitie hangeth not vpon the aiery esteeme of vulger
                    opinion, but is indeed of it selfe essentiall and absolute. </p>
                <p>Beside, Nobilitie being inherent and Naturall, can haue (as the Diamond) the
                    lustre but onely from it selfe: <note place="margin-right">AEneas Siluius lib.

                    it is by doing iustly to obtaine a Kingdome, and as glorious to prefer Iustice

                    in his Hiftorie by Machiauell. This Cosmo (saith he) was the most esteemed, and
                    most famous Cits<pb facs="00023" n="7"/>zen (being no man of warre) that euer
                    had beene in the memorie of man, either in Florence, or any other Citie; because
                    he did not onely excell all others (of his time) in Authoritis and Riches, but
                    also in Liberalitie and Wisedome. For among other qualities which aduanced him
                    to bee chiefe of his Countrey, hee was more then other men liberals and
                    magnificent, which liberalitie appeared much more after his death then before.
                    For his sonne Piero found by his Fathers Records, that there was not any Citizen
                    of estimation, to whom Cosmo had not lent great summes of Money: and many times
                    also be did lend to those Gentlemen, whom hee knew to haue need. His
                    magnificence appeared by diuers his buildings: For within the Citie of Florence
                    hee builded the Abbaies and Temples of S. Marco, S. Lorenzo, and the Monastery
                    of S. Verdiana, &amp; in the mountaines of Fiesole, S. Girolamo, with the
                    Abbey thereto belonging. Also in Mugello he did not onely repaire the Church for
                    the Friers, but tooke it downe, and built it anew. Besides those magnificent
                    buildings in S. Croce, in S. Agnoli, and S. Miniato, he made Altars, and
                    sumptuous Chappels. All which Temples and Chappels, besides the buildings of
                    them, were by himpaued, and furnished throughly with all things necessary. With
                    these publique buildings, wee may number his priuate houses, whereof one within
                    the City meete for so great a personage, and foure other without, at Carriaggi,
                    at Fiesole, at Casaggiuolo, and at Trebio, all Palaces fitter for Princes then
                    priuate persons. And because his magnificent houses in Italy did not in his
                    opinion make him famous enough, hee builded in Ierusalem an Hospitall to receiue
                    poore and diseased Pilgrimes. In which worke hee consumed great summes of money.
                    And albeit these buildings, and euery other his actions were princely, and that
                    in Florence hee liued like a Prince; yet so gouerned by wisedome, as he neuer
                    exceeded the bounds of ciuill modesty. For in his conuersation, in riding, in
                    marrying his Children and Kinsfolkes, hee was like vnto all other modest and
                    discreete Citizens: because hee well knew that extraordi<pb facs="00024" n="8"

                    infinite others of like Nature: yet the ancient Nobilitie (whereof there are
                    many Honourable families; as Hohenlo, Egmont, Horne, Brederode, Waggenaër,
                    Botselaër, with sundry others) keepe themselues entire, and maintaining their

                    gouernment; for who will hazzard his person and estate to infinite dangers for
                    Honour, when others at home may haue it sine sudore &amp; sanguine, onely by
                    bleeding in the vena caua, called marsupium? The pure Oyle cannot mingle with
                    the water, no more this extracted quintessence and Spirit of Vertue, with the

                    of vn worthinesse. Euripides, when his Father told him he was knighted, made him

                    the street. The French man is so bold, as to terme such intruders

                    first part of it, should returne methelatter. </p>
                <p>Lastly, to conclude, most pitifull is the pride of many, who when they are nobly
                    borne, not onely staine their stocke with vice, and all base behauiour, relying
                    and vaunting of their long pedegrees, and exploits of their Fathers, (themselues
                    liuing in sloath and idlenesse)<pb facs="00033" n="17"/>disparage and disgrace
                    those, who by their vertuous endeuours are rising. To these and such, I oppose
                    Marius, and that stout reply of his in Salust: They contemne mee as an vpstart,
                    I scorne their sloath and basenesse. Againe, What they idlely heare and reade at
                    home, my selfe hath either acted or seene; if they scorne mee, let them scorne
                    their Ancestors, who came by their Nobilitie as I haue done: If they enuy mine
                    Honour, let them also enuy my labours, mine innocence, my perils, &amp;c.
                    Now see how equally they deale: that which they arrogate to themselues from the
                    vertue of others, that they deny me for mine owne, because I haue no Images, and
                    my Nobilitie is new, &amp;c. Shortly after: I cannot, to prooue my discent,
                    bring forth the Images of my Ancestors, their Triumphs, their Consulships; but
                    if neede be, I cap shew Launces, my Ensigne, Caparisons, and other such warlike
                    implements, beside a number of scarres vpon my breast: these are my Images, my
                    Nobilitie, not left me by descent and in heritance, &amp;c. And as resolute
                    of late yeeres, was the answere of Verdugo a Spaniard, Commander in Friseland,

                    importeth:) Gentlemen (quoth he) question not my birth, or who my Father was, I
                    am the sonne of mine owne desert and Fortune; if any man dares as mach as I haue
                    done, let him come and take the Tables end with all my heart. </p>

                    Lawes; That thereby might appeare the goodnesse of God, in protecting the good,

                <p>A fourth error, is the contrary (for, Stulti in contrariae currunt), too much
                    carelesnesse and remissnesse in not holding them in at all, or not giuing them
                    in the Schoole that due attendance they ought: so that euery day is play-day
                    with them, bestowing the Summer in seeking Birds-nests, or haunting Orchards;
                    the Winter, in keeping at home for cold, or abroad all day with the Bow, or the
                    birding-peece: they making as little consclence in taking, as their Master in
                    giuing their learning, who forgetteth <note place="margin-left">Plutarch, ad
                        Traianum.</note> belike, that Rumour layeth each fault of the Scholar vpon
                    his necke. Plato remembreth one Protagoras, a Bird of the same feather, who when
                    he had liued threescore yeares, made his boast, he had spent fortie of those
                    threescore, in corrupting and vndoing youth. We haue, I feare, a race of those
                    Protagor-asses euen yet among our common Schoole-masters in England. </p>
                <p>But the diseases whereunto some of them are very subiect, are Humour and Folly
                    (that I may say nothing of the grosse Ignorance and in-sufficiency of many)
                    whereby they become ridiculous and contemptible both in the Schoole and abroad.
                    Hence it comes to passe, that in<pb facs="00043" n="27"/>many places, especially
                    in Italy, of all professions that of Pedanteria is held in basest repute; the
                    Schoole-master almost in euery Comedy being brought vpon the Stage, to paralell
                    the Zani, or Pantaloun. He made vs good sport in that excellent Comedy of
                    Pedantius, acted in our Trinite Colledge in Cambridge: and if I bee not
                    deceiued, in Priscianus vapulans, and many of our English Playes. </p>
                <p>I knew one, who in Winter would ordinarily in a cold morning, whip his Boyes ouer
                    for no other purpose then to get himselfe a hear: another beat them for
                    swearing, and all the while sweares himselfe with horrible oathes, he would
                    forgiue any fault sauing that. </p>
                <p>I had I remember my selfe (neere S. Albanes in Hertfordshire where I was borne) a
                    Master, who by no entreatie would teach any Scholler he had, farther then his
                    Father had learned before him, as if he had onely learned but to reade English,
                    the sonne, though he went with him seauen yeares, should go no further; his
                    reason was, they would then prooue saucy rogues, and controule their Fathers;
                    yet these are they that ostentimes haue our hopefull Gentry vnder their charge
                    and tuition, to bring them vp in science and ciuilitie. </p>
                <p>Beside, most of them want that good and direct Method, whereby in shortest time
                    and with least labour, the Scholler may attaine vnto perfection; some teaching
                    priuately, vse a Grammar of their owne making; some againe, none at all: the
                    most Lillies, but praeposterously posted ouer, that the boy is in his Quantitie
                    of Syllables, before hee knoweth the Qualitie of any one part of speech; for hee
                    profiteth no more then he mastereth by his vnderstanding, Nor is it my meaning
                    that I would all Masters to be tyed to one Methode, no more then all the Shires

                    since Method, as one saith, is but <gap reason="omitted"/>, let euery Master if

                    as if they went blindfold for a wager: hence commeth the shifting of the

                    beaten for his paines. They cannot commonly erre, if they shall imitate the
                    builder, first to prouide the Scholler with matter, then cast to lay a good
                    foundation, I meane a solide vnderstanding of the Grammar, euery rule made
                    familiar and fast, by short and pleasant examples, let him bring his matter into

                    heere most profitable and needfull, that is, Translation. For I know nothing
                    that benefiteth a Scholler more then that; first by translating out of Latine
                    into English, which laid by for some time, let him translate out of English into
                    Latine againe varying as oft as he can both his words and Phrases. Doserus who
                    hath gathered all the Phrases of <unclear reason="illegible">Tullie</unclear>

                    fontibus, next exercise himselfe in Theames and Declamation if he be able. The
                    old method of teaching Grammar, saith Suetonius, was disputation in the
                    fore-noone, and declamation in the after-noone; but this I leaue to the
                    discretion of the iudicious Master. </p>

                    it selfe; many of them being no Grammarians at all, much lesse (as Quintilian

                    Milke or Water for their drinke, and their meate such as they could kill or

                    no education at all, (thinking their birth or estate will beare out that): or if

                    a Tree, it is ouer-growne with the old barke by the next Summer. Beside, such is

                <p>Is it not commonly seene, that the most Gentlemen<pb facs="00048" n="32"/>will

                    man to bring vp their children? It may be, hence it is that Dogges are able to
                    make Syllogismes in the fields, when their young Masters can conclude nothing at

                    way, and good Masters haue likewise done their parts, and neither want of will
                    or abilitie of wit in their Children to become Schollers, yet (whether out of an

                    from Schoole, as Birds out of the nest, ere they be flidge, and send them so
                    young to the Vniuersitie, that scarce one among twentie proueth ought. For as

                    professions altogether contrary to their dispositions: This, saith Erasmus, is,
                    peccare in genium. And certainly it is a principall point of discretion in
                    parents to be throughly acquainted with and obserue, the disposition and

                    certaine age, they to choose what liked them best, and euer after to take vpon

                    L. Chauncelor of England) that Erasmus saith, he found them so ready and perfect
                    in Lillie, that the worst Scholler of them was able to expound him quitethrough
                    without any stop, except some extraordinarie and difficult place. Quod me (saith
                    he) aut mei similem esset remoraturum. I shall not neede to remember, within

                <p>Lastly, the fault may be in the Scholler himselfe, whom Nature hath not so much
                    befriended with the gift of vnderstanding, as to make him capable of knowledge;

                    industry; wee neuer reade of any Master Virgil euer had. S. Augustine likewise
                    saith of himselfe: Se didicisse Aristotelis Categorias nemine tradente: That hee
                    learned Aristotles Categories, or Praedicaments, no man instructing him; which,

                    and those perillous pikes of the Grammar rules) as a well willer vnto you and
                    your studies, to beare you company part of the way, and to direct henceforth my
                    Discourse wholly to your selfe. </p>
                <p>Since the Vniuersitie whereinto you are embodied, is not vntruly called the Light
                    and Eye of the Land, in regard from hence, as from the Center of the Sunne, the
                    glorious beames of Knowledge disperse th&#x0113;selues ouer all, without
                    which a Chaos of blindnesse would repossesse vs againe: thinke now that you are
                    in publike view, and nucibus relictis, with your gowne you haue put on the man,
                    that from hence the reputation of your whole life taketh her first growth and
                    beginning. For as no glory crowneth with more abundant praise, then that which
                    is heere won by diligence and wit: so there is no infamie abaseth the value and
                    esteeme of a Gentleman all his life after, more then that procured by Sloath and
                    Error in the Vniuersities; yea, though in those yeares whose innocencie haue
                    euer pleaded their pardon; whereat I haue not a little meruailed, confidering

                    keepe within, and are warie of themselues, escape with more safetie: so it
                    falleth out here in the Vniuersitie; for this Eye hath also her diseases as wel
                    as any other part of the body, (I will not say with the Physitians more) with

                    <note place="margin-left">Cicero. 1. de Oratore.</note> SInce speech is the
                    Character of a man, and the Interpreter of his mind, and writing, the Image of
                    that; that so often as we speak or write, so oft we vndergoe censure and
                    iudgement of our selues: labour first by all meanes to get the habit of a good
                    stile in speaking and writing, as well English as Latine. I call with Tully
                        <note place="margin-left">Cic. inprolog Rhetor.</note> that a good and
                    eloquent stile of speaking, Where there is a iudicious fitting of choise words,
                    apt and graue Sentences vnto matter well disposed, the same being vttered with a
                    comely moderation of the vice, countenance and gesture. Not that same ampullous
                    &amp; Scenical pompe, with emptie furniture of phrase, wherewith the Stage,
                    and our pettie Poeticke Pamphlets sound so big, which like a net in the water,
                    though it feeleth weightie, yet it yeeldeth nothing; since our speech ought to
                    resemble wherin neither the curiousnesse of the Picture, or faire proportion of
                    Letters, but the weight is to be regarded: and as Plutarch saith, when our
                    thirst is quenched with the drinke,<pb facs="00059" n="43"/>then weel ooke vpon
                    the ennameling and workmanship of the boule; so first your hearer coueteth to
                    haue his desire satisfied with matter, ere hee looketh vpon the forme or vinetry
                    of words, which many times fall in of themselues to matter well contriued,
                    according to Horace: </p>

                <p>Let your stile therefore bee furnished with solid matter, and compact of the
                    best, choise, and most familiar words; taking heed of speaking, or writing such
                    words, as men shall rather admire then vnderstand. Herein were Tiberius, M.
                    Anthony, and Moecenas, much blamed and iested at by Augustus, himselfe vsing
                    euer a plaine and most familiar stile: and as it is said of him, Verbum insolens
                        <note place="margin-right">Henricus Octauus Angliae Rex in epistola quad am

                    Then sententious, yea better furnished with sentences then words, and (as Tully
                    willeth) without affectation: for asa King said, Dum tersiori studemus eloqueudi
                    formulae, subterfugit nos olanculùm, apertus ille &amp; familiaris dicendi
                    modus. Flowing at one and the selfe same height, neither taken in and knit vp
                    too short, that like rich hangings of Arras or Tapistry, thereby lo se their
                    grace and beautie, as The mistocles was wont to say: nor suffered to spred so
                    farre like soft Musicke in an open field, whose delicious sweetnesse vanisheth,
                    and is lost in the ayre, not being contained within the walles of a roome. In
                    speaking, rather lay downe your words one by one, then poure them foorth
                    together; this hath made many men naturally slow of speech, to seem wisely
                    iudicious, and be iudiciously wise; for, beside the grace it giueth to the
                    Speaker, it much helpeth the memorie of the hearer, and is a good remedy against
                    impediment of speech. Sir Nicholas Bacon, sometime Lord Chancellor of England,
                    and father to my<pb facs="00060" n="44"/>Lord of S. Albanes, a most eloquent
                    man, and of as sound learning and wisedome, as England bred in many Ages: with
                    the old Lord William Burghley, Lord Treasurer of England; haue aboue others
                    herein beene admired, and commended in their publique speeches in the
                    Parliamenthouse and Starre-Chamber: for nothing drawes our attention more then
                    good matter, eloquently digested, and vttered with a gracefull, cleere, and
                    distinct pronuntiation. </p>
                <p>But to be sure your stile may passe for currant, as of the richest alloy, imitate
                    the best Authors as wel in Oratorie as Historie; beside the exercise of your
                    owne Inuention, with much conference with those who can speak well: nor bee so
                    foolish precise as a number are, who make it Religion to speake otherwise then
                    this or that Author. As Longolius was laughed at by the learned, for his so
                    apish and superstitious imitation of Tully, in so much as hee would haue thought
                    a whole Volume quite marred, if the word Possibile had passed his pen; because
                    it is not to be found in all Tullie: or euery Sentence had not sunke with, esse
                    posse videatur, like a peale ending with a chime, or an Amen vpon the Organes in
                    Paules. For as the young Virgin to make her fairest Garlands, gathereth not
                    altogether one kind of Flower; and the cunning Painter, to make a delicate
                    beauty, is forced to mixe his Complexion, and compound it of many Colours; the
                    Arras-worker, to please the eyes of Princes, to be acquainted with many
                    Histories: so are you to gather <note place="margin-left">Exod. 4.</note> this
                    Hony of eloquence, A gift of heauen, out of many fields; making it your owne by
                    diligence in collection, care in expression, and skill in digestion. But let me
                    leade you forth into these all-flowrie and verdant fields, where so much sweete

                    eloquij: whose words and stile (that you may not bee held an Heretique of all
                    the world) you must preferre aboue all other, as well for the sweetnesse,
                    grauitie, richnesse, and vnimitable texture thereof; as that his workes are
                    throughout seasoned with all kind of Learning, and relish of a singular and
                    Christianlike honesty. There wanted <note place="margin-right">Tacitus in

                    Musicke, of no manner of Art that was commendable and honest; he knew the
                    subtiltie of Logick, each part of Morall Philosophy, and so forth. How well he
                    was seen in the Ciuill Lawes, his Bookes De legibus, and the actions in Verrem,
                    wil shew you: which are the rather worthy your reading, because you shall there
                    see the grounds of many of our Lawes heere in England. For the integritie of his
                    mind, though his Offices had lien suppressed, let this <note
                        place="margin-right">Ad. Atticum. lib. 13.</note> one saying (among many
                    thousands) perswade you to a charitable opinion of the same: A recta conscientia
                    transuersum vnguem, non oportet quenquam in omni sua vita discedere. Whereto I
                    might adde that tale of Gyges ring in his Offices, which booke let it not seeme
                    contemptible vnto you, because it lyeth tossed and torne in euery Schoole; but
                    bee precious, as it was sometime vuto the old Lord Burghley, Lord high Treasurer
                    of England, before named; who, to his dying day, would alwaies carry it about
                    him, either in his bosome o pocket, beeing sufficient (as one said of Aristotles
                    Rhetoriques) to make both a Scholler and an honest man. Imitate Tully for his
                    phrase and stile, especially in his Epistles Ad Atticum; his Bookes De Oratore:
                    among his Orations, those Pro M. Marcello, Pro Archia Poeta, T. Annio Milone,
                    Sext. Rosc. Amerino; Pub. Quinctio the first two against Catiline; and the third
                    Action against Verres. These in my opinion are fullest of life, but you may vse
                    your discretion, you cannot make your choice amisse. </p>

                    circumstance and preparation. counsels and deliberations had before, effects and
                    euents after: which is quite contrary; as may be seene by the Conspiracie of
                    Catiline, which hee might in a manner haue set downe in three words. But how
                    amply, and with what adoe doth he describe it? what circumstances more open,
                    more abundant, then where he saith; The Romane Souldiers beeing amazed with an
                    vnwonted vprore, betooke them to their Weapons: some hid themselues, others
                    aduised their Companions to stand stoutly to it: they were afraid in euery
                    place, the multitude of Enemies was so great. The heauen was obscured with
                    night, and thicke Cloudes, the perill was doubtfull: and lastly, no man knew
                    whether it were safest for him to flye, or to stay by it? And let them now see
                    their error, who affirme his Discourse to bee vnfurnished of Counsels,
                    Deliberations, Consultations, &amp;c. Is not the reason set downe, why

                <p>Now in respect of Heauen, it is so small a point, that the least Starre is not
                    darkened with the shadow thereof: for if the smallest Starre, albeit in
                    iudgement of our sence, seemeth but a pricke or point, yet farre exceedeth the
                    body of the Earth in greatnesse, it followeth in respect of Heauen, that the
                    Earth must seeme as little. </p>
                <p>Beside, if the Earth were of any quantitie in respect of the higher Orbes, the
                    Starres should seeme bigger or lesse in regard of those Hypsomata (Altitudes) or
                    the Climes: but it is certaine that at the selfe same time, sundry Astronomers
                    finde the same bignesse and eleuation of the selfe same Starre obserued by their
                    calculation, to differ no whit at all; whereby we may see if that distance of
                    place which is on the Earth (in respect of the Heauenly Orbes) exceedeth all
                    sence, it followes that the Earth (poore little point as it is) seemes the like,
                    if it be compared with Heauen: yet this is that point, which with fire and
                    sword, is diuided among so many Nations, the matter of our Glorie; our seate;

                    demanded when the warre and miserie of Greece should haue an end, replyed: If
                    they would double the Altar in Delos, which was cubique forme; which they tryed
                    by adding another cube vnto it, but that auailed nothing: Plato then taking vpon
                    him to expound this riddle, affirmed, the Greekes were reproued by Apollo<pb
                        facs="00093" n="77"/>because they were ignorant of Geometry. nor herein can
                    I blame them, since the doubling of the Cube in Solides, and Quadrature of the
                    Circle in plaine, hath euer since so troubled our greatest Geometricians, that I
                    fear except Apollo himselfe ascend from Hell to resolue his owue Probleme, we
                    shall not see it among our ordinarie Stone-cutters effected. </p>
                <p>But in breife the vse you shall haue of Geometry, will be in suruaying your
                    lands, affoording your opinion in building anew, or translating; making your
                    milles aswell for grinding of corne as throwing foorth water from your lower

                <p> TO sweeten your seuerer studies, by this time vouchsafe Poetry your respect;
                    which howsoeuer censured and seeming fallen from the highest Stage of Honour, to
                    the lowest staire of disgrace, let not your iudgement bee infected with that
                    pestilent ayre of the common breath, to be an infidell; in whose beleefe, and
                    doer of their contrary Actions, is to be religious in the right, and to merit if
                    it were possible by good workes. </p>
                <p>The Poet, as that Laurell Maia dreamed of, is made by miracle from his mothers
                    wombe, and like the Diamond onely polished and pointed of himselfe, disdaining
                    the file and midwifery of forraine helpe. </p>
                <p>Hence Tullie was long ere he could bee deliuered of a few verses, and those poore
                    ones too: and Ouid, so backward in prose, that he could almost speake nothing
                    but verse. And experience daily affordeth vs many excellent yong and growing
                    wits, as well from the Plow as Pallace, endued naturally with this Diuine and
                    heauenly gift, yet not knowing (if you should aske the question) whether a
                    Metaphore be flesh or fish. </p>
                <p>If bare saying Poetrie is an heauenly gift, be too weake a proppe to vphold her
                    credite with those buzzardly poore ones, who hauing their feathers moulted can
                    creepe no farther then their owne puddle, able onely to enuie this Imperiall
                    Eagle for sight and flight; let them if they can <note place="margin-left">Plato

                    her bosome, as both Plato and Tully in his Tusculanes affirme. </p>
                <p>Strabo saith, Poetrie was the first Philosophie that euer was taught, nor were
                    there euer any writers thereof knowne before Musaeus, Hesiod and Homer: by whose
                    authority Plato, Aristotle and Galen, determine their weightiest controuersies,
                    and confirme their reasons in Philosophy. And what were the songs of Linus,
                    Orpheus, Amphyon, Olympus, and that dittie Iopas sang to his harpe at Dido's
                    banquet, but Naturall and Morall Philosophy, sweetned with the pleasance of
                    Numbers, that Rudenesse and Barbarisme might the better taste and digest the
                    lessons of ciuilitie? according to Lucretius (Italianized by Ariosto) and
                    englished by Sir Iohn Harrington. </p>

                    Allegories, as the vine plantedin AEgypt; what Epiphonema's, prosopopoea's and
                    whatsoeuer else may be required, to the texture of so rich and glorious a peece? </p>
                <p>And the song of Salomon (which is onely left vs of a thousand) is it not a
                    continued Allegorie of the Mysticall loue betwixt Christ and his Church?
                    Moreouer the Apostles th&#x0113;selues haue not disdained to alledge the
                    authoritie of the heathen Poets, Aratus, Menander and Epimenides; as also the
                    fathers of the Church, Nazianzen, S. Augustine, Bernard, Prudentius, with many
                    other, beside the allowance they haue giuen of Poetrie, they teach vs the true
                    vse and end thereof, which is to compasse the Songs of Sion, and addresse the
                    fruite of our inuention to his glory who is the author of so goodly a gift,
                    which we abuse to ourloues, light fancies, and basest affections. </p>
                <p>And if Mechanicall Arts hold their estimation by their effects in base subiects,
                    how much more deferueth this to be esteemed, rhat holdeth so soueraigne a power
                    ouer the minde, can turne brutishnesse into Ciuilitie, make the lewd honest
                    (which is Scaligers opinion of Virgils Poeme) turne hatred to loue, cowardise
                    into valour, and in briefe, like a Queen command ouer all affections? </p>

                    with either. I remember Plutarch telleth vs of Telesilla, a noble and braue
                    Ladie, who being dangerously sicke, and imagined past recouery, was by the
                    Oracle, aduised to apply her minde to the Muse and poetrie; which shee
                    diligently obseruing recouered in a short space, and withall grew so sprightly
                    couragious, that hauing well fortified Argos with diuers companies of women
                    onely, her self with her c&#x014D;panions sallying out, entertained
                    Cleomenes K. of the Lacedaemoni&#x0101;s with such a Camisado, that he was
                    faine to shew his back,<pb facs="00097" n="81"/>leauing a good part of his
                    people behinde, to fill ditches; and then by plaine force of Armes draue out
                    Demaratus another king, who lay very strong in garrison within. </p>
                <p>Alexander by the reading of Homer, was especially mooued to goe through with his
                    conquests. </p>
                <p>Leonidas also that braue King of the Spartanes, being asked how Tirtaeus (who
                    wrote of warre in verse) was esteemed am&#x014D;g Poets, replied
                    excellently: For my souldiers, quoth he, mooued onely with his verses, runne
                    with a resolute courage to the battaile, fearing no perill at all. </p>
                <p>What other thing gaue an edge to the valour of our ancient Britons, but their
                    Bardes (remembred by Athenaeus, Lucan and sundry other), recording in verse the
                    braue exploits of their nation, and singing the same vnto their Harps at their
                    publike feasts and meetings? amongst whom Taließin a learned Bard, and Master to

                    famous Poet, leaning vpon his elbow at a Tables end fast asleepe, shee stooping
                    downe, and openly kissing him, said; Wee must honour with our kisse, the mouth
                    from whence so many sweete verses and golden Poems haue proceeded. </p>
                <p>But some may aske me, How it falleth out, that Poets now adaies are of no such
                    esteeme, as they haue beene in former times? I answer; because vertue in our
                    declining and worser daies, generally findeth no regard: Or rather more truely
                    with Aretine (being demanded why Princes were not so liberall to Poesie, and
                    other good Arts, as in former times) Because the consience telleth them, how
                    vnworthy they are of their praises giuen them by Poets, as for other Arts, they
                    make no account of that they know not. </p>
                <p>But since we are heere (hauing before ouer-runne the Champaigne and large field
                    of Historie) let vs a while rest our selues in the garden of the Muses, and

                <p>We must beginne with the King of Latine Poets, whom Nature hath reared beyond
                    imitation, and who aboue al other onely, deserueth the name of a Poet; I mean
                    Virgil. In him you shall at once finde (not else-where) that <note

                    Vnder Prudence is comprehended out of generall learning and iudgement, that
                    discreet, apt suting and dis<pb facs="00099" n="83"/>posing, as well of Actions
                    as Words in their due place, time and manner; which in Virgil is not obserued by
                    one among twenty of our ordinary Grammarians, Who (to <note place="margin-right"
                        >In Poetic. lib. 3. qui &amp; Idea. ca. 25.</note> vse the words of the

                    face of the Virgilian Sea. How diuinely, according to the Platonickes, doth he
                    discourse of the Soule? how properly of the Nature, number of winds, seasons of
                    the yeare, qualities of Beasts, Nature of Hearbs? What in-sight into ancient
                    Chronologie and Historie? In briefe, what not worthy the knowledge of a diuine
                    wit? To make his AEneas a man of extraordinary aspect, and comlinesse of
                    personage, he makes Venus both his mother and Lady of his Horoscope. And
                    forasmuch as griefe and perpetuall care, are inseparable companions of all great
                    and noble atchieuements, he giues him Achates quasi <gap reason="omitted"/>, his
                    faithfull companion? What immooued constancy, when no teares or entreaty of
                    Eliza could cause him stay? What Piety, Pitty, Fortitude, beyond his companions.
                    See how the Diuine Poet gaue him leaue to be wounded, lest his valour in so many
                    skirmishes might bee questioned, and that a farre off, not at hand, that rather
                    it might be in, puted to his Fortune, then his rashnesse or weaknesse; then by
                    one who could not be knowne, to giue the enemy occasion rather of feare, then of
                    challenging the glorie. And whereas he bringeth in Camilla, a couragious Lady,
                    and inuincible at the Swords point in encountring other; yet <note
                        place="margin-right">AEneid. 11.</note> he neuer bringeth her to try her
                    valour with AEneas. Againe, that Tarchon and she might shew their braue deeds he
                    makes AEneas absent: as also when Turnus so resolutely brake into his Tents.
                    Lastly, what excellent iudgmen sheweth he in appropriating the accidents and
                    Histories of his owne times, to those of the ancient, as where he bringeth in
                    Venulus plucked by force from his Horse, and carried away with full speed? The
                    like Caesar confesseth to haue happened to himselfe. AEneas with his<pb

                        <note place="margin-left">Parcite ciuibus</note> from slaughter. The like
                    did Caesar at the battaile of Pharsalie, and with the same words. But thus much

                    better disposeth the minde to what is commendable and vertuous. </p>

                    preserueth the memory of a dearest Friend, or fairest Mistresse. And since it is
                    onely the imitation of the surface of Nature, by it as in a booke of golden and
                    rare-limmed Letters, the chiefe end of it, wee reade a continuall Lecture of the

                    </note> Miracle, as Aristotle saith. </p>
                <p>And that you should not esteeme bafely of the practise thereof, let me tell you,
                    that in auncient times Painting was admitted into the first place among the
                    liberall Arts, and throughout all Greece taught onely to the children of<pb
                        facs="00122" n="106"/>Noble men in the schooles, and altogether forbidden to
                    be taught to seruants or slaues. </p>
                <p>In no lesse honour and esteeme was it held among the Romanes, as wee find in
                    Plinie and many others who euery where advance the professors; and the dignity
                    of the practise thereof nothing base or seruile, since one of the most Noble
                    families in Rome, the Fabij thought themselues much honoured by the addition of
                    that Sirname Pictor. For the first of that name, although he was most honourably
                    descended, honoured with many Titles, Consulships and Triumphs, excellently
                    learned in the lawes, and beside accounted in the number of the Orators of his
                    time; yet he thought his skil in painting added to these Honors, and his memory
                    would heare the better of posteritie, for that he was endued with so excellent a
                    quality: for after with his owne hand he had painted the Temple of Salus round
                    about within, and finished his worke, he wrote in faire letters in an eminent
                    place, Quintus Fabius pinxi. </p>
                <p>Neither was it the exercise of Nobilitie among the ancients onely, but of late
                    dayes and in our times we see it practised by the greatest Princes of Europe,
                    without praeiudice to their Honors. Francis the first, king of France, was very
                    excellent with his pencil; and the vertuous Margaret Queene of Navarre beside
                    her excellent veine in Poesie could draw and limne excellently; the like <note
                        place="margin-left">Lomazius.</note> is reported of Emanuel Duke of Sauoie. </p>
                <p>Nor can I ouerpasse the ingenuitie and excellencie of many Nobles and Gentlemen
                    of our owne nation herein, of whom I know many; but none in my opinion, who
                    deserueth more respect and admiration for his skill and practise herein then
                    Master Nathaniel Bacon of Broome in Suffolke (younger sonne to the most
                    Honourable and bountifull minded Sir Nicholas Bacon, Knight, and eldest
                    Barronet), not inferiour in my iudgement to our skilfullest Masters, But
                    certainely I know not what fauoura<pb facs="00123" n="107"/>ble aspect of Heauen
                    that right noble and ancient family which produceth like delicate fruits from
                    one Stemme so many excellent in seuerall qualities, that no one name or family
                    in England can say the like. </p>
                <p>Painting is quality I loue (I confesse) and admire in others, because euer
                    naturall from a child, I haue beene addicted to the practise here of; yet when I
                    was young I haue beene cruelly beaten by ill and ignorant schoolemasters, when I
                    haue beene taking, in white and black, the countenance of some one or other
                    (which I could do at thirteene and fourteene yeares of age: beside the mappe of
                    anytowne according to Geometricall proportion, as I did of Cambridge when I was
                    of Trinitie Collidge, and a Iunior Sophister), yet could they neuer beate it out
                    of me. I remember one Master I had (and yet liuing not farre from S. Albanes)
                    took me one time drawing out with my pen that peare-tree and boyes throwing at
                    it, at the end of the Latin Grammar: which he perceiuing in a rage strooke mee
                    with the great end of the rodde, and rent my paper, swearing it was the onely
                    way to teach me to robbe Orchards; beside, that I was placed with him to be made
                    a scholler and not a painter, which I was very likely to doe; wh&#x0113; I
                    well remember he construed vnto me the beginning of the first Ode in Horace,
                    Edite, set ye forth, Moecenas, the sports, atavis Regibus of our ancient kings:
                    but leauing my ingenious Master, to our purpose. </p>
                <p>For your first beginning and entrance in draught, make your hand as ready as you
                    can (without the helpe of your compasses) in those generall figures of the
                    Circle, ovall, square, triangle, cylinder, &amp;c. for these are the
                    foundation of all other proportions. As for example, your ovall directs you in
                    giuing a iust proportion to the face. Your Square or Cube for all manner of
                    ground plots, formes of fortification; wherein you haue no vse of the Circle at
                    all. Your Circle againe directs you in all orbi<pb facs="00124" n="108"/>cular
                    formes whatsoeuer, and so forth of the rest. </p>
                <p>Hauing made your hand fit and ready in generall proportion, learne to giue all
                    bodies their true shaddowes according to their eminence and concauity, &amp;
                    to heighthen or deepe, as your body appeareth neerer or farther from the light;
                    which is a matter of great iudgement, and indeede the soule (as I may say) of a
                    picture. </p>
                <p>Then learne all manner of Draperie, that is, to giue garments and all manner of
                    stuffes, cloth, silke, and linnen their naturall and proper soldes; which at the
                    first will seeme strange and difficult vnto you, but by imitating the choisest
                    printes and peeces of the most iudicious masters, with your owne obseruance you
                    will very easily attaine the skill. But since I haue already published a booke
                    of Drawing and Limning, wherein I haue discouered whatsoeuer I haue thought
                    necessarie to perfection herein; I will referre you for farther instruction to
                    it, and onely here giue you the principall Authors for your Imitation. </p>
                <p><note place="margin-left">Albert. Durer.</note> Since, as I said proportion is
                    the principall and chiefe thing you are first to learne, I commend vnto you that

                    for proportion and draperie are the best that are, hee hath written a very
                    learned booke of Symmetrie and proportions, which hath beene since translated
                    out of high Dutch into Latine. And though his peeces haue beene long since worne
                    out of presse, yet you may happen vpon them among our skilfull painters, which
                    if you can get reasonably, keep them as iewels, since I beleeue you shall neuer
                    see their like: they seeme old, and commonly are marked with a great D in an A. </p>

                    confesse with greater iudgment, and is generally of more esteeme then working in
                    water colours; but then it is more Mechanique and will robbe you of ouer much
                    time from your more excellent studies, it being sometime a fortnight or a month
                    ere you can finish an ordinary peece. I haue knowne Michael Ianss of Delf in
                    Holland, the most excellent painter of all the Low Countries, to haue beene (at
                    times), a whole halfe yeare about a picture, yet in the end to haue blurred it
                    out (as it is his manner) for some small disresemblance, eyther in the eye or
                    mouth; so curious is the workemanship to doe it well: beside, oyle nor oyle
                    colours, if they drop vpon apparell, will not out; when water colours will with
                    the least washing. But lest you should thinke mee ignorant or enuious, I will
                    not conceale from you the manner of working herein, and though it may be you
                    shall not practise it, it may profit others. </p>

                    then let it dry, then white it ouer againe, and so the third time, when being
                    dry, scrape it very euen with a sharpe knife till it be smooth, then prime it
                    with red lead or some other colour, which being dry, draw your picture out vpon
                    it with a peece of chalke, pencill of coale, lastly, with black lead; so lay on

                    the complection) Lampe black, vmber for the haire, red Lead, yellow Oaker,
                    Verdigreace; then your Blewes, Masticot and Pinke, the rest at your pleasure,

                <p>To begin a Picture, first drawe the Eye, the white thereof make of white Lead
                    with a litle Charcoale black; hauing finished it, leaue from the other Eye the

                    Face, after that make the Mouth, the Eare, the Haire, &amp;c. </p>
                <p>After you haue made the white of the Eyes, and proportion of the Nose,

                    flesh colour is commonly compounded of white lead, lake, and vermilion, but you
                    may heighthen or deepen it at your pleasure. </p>

                    <p> Italy being ouer-runne, and miserably wasted with warres, what time all good
                        learning and Arts lay negle<pb facs="00134" n="118"/>cted about the yeare
                        1240. Painting and Painters were there so rare, that they were faine to send
                        into Greece for men skillfull herein. Of whom the Italians learned the
                        rudiments and principles of this Art, in a manner quite lost amongst them.
                        So that while certaine Graecian Painters, sent for by some of the Nobilitie
                        of Florence, were painting a Church in Florence, on Ioannes Cimabus a young
                        man, and naturally affecting this Art, grew so farre into familiar
                        acquaintance with them that he learned the manner of their draught, and
                        mingling colours, that in a short time he excelled the best Masters among
                        them; and was the first that I can finde among the Italians, that brought
                        Painting into credit, and got a name by his skill herein. For some of his
                        peeces for the raritie were carried out of his house into the new Church in
                        Florence, with Musicall Instruments of all sorts, and solemne procession;
                        other being vttered at great rates ouer all France and Italy; insomuch, as
                        Charles the French King moued with his fame, came to Florence to see his
                        Worke. He died in the yeare 1300. leauing behind him his Scholler Giotto,
                        who by the opinion of Dantes in his Purgatorie farre surpassed him: He was
                        so humorous, saith the Interpreter of Dantes, that if himselfe or any other
                        espyed any fault in his work, he would (like Michael Ianss. now liuing at
                        Delft in Holland) deface and breake it in peeces, though he had bestowed a
                        twelue-moneths paines thereon. </p>

                        temper the size for them: so they wrought together; but the rudenesse of

                    <p> Giotto was not onely a rare Painter, but also an excellent Architect, for
                        all manner of curious conceipt in building: and to say truth, was the first
                        who of latter times in Italy brought picture into admiration, and her true
                        height. He was borne at Vespignano, a village foureteene Italian miles from
                        Florence: his father was an husbandman, and Giotto being a Boy of some
                        twelue yeares of age, was set by him to keepe sheepe: but Nature hauing
                        ordained him for another end; the Boy while hee was tending his sheepe,
                        would be practising with a sticke vpon the sand, or dustie high-way, or vpon
                        void places vpon walls with a Coale, to draw whatsoeuer sorted with his
                        fancie. It fortuned on a time, while he was drawing<pb facs="00136" n="120"
                        />the picture of one of his sheepe, Cimabus to passe by, who admiring such
                        Art in the Boyes draught, (who had neuer any other direction saue out of his
                        naturall inclination) demanded of him if he would dwell with him: who
                        answered, Yea, if his father were so contented. The father agreed, and
                        placed him with Cimabus, who in short time so excelled, that he farre
                        surpassed the rusticke Greeke manner of working, bringing forth a better
                        Moderne Art, and the true working by the life, which had not beene knowne in
                        two hundred years before. He was very inward and familiar with Dantes the
                        Poet, whose picture he drew: he was of all others famous for his skill and
                        conceipt in expressing affections, and all manner of gesture, so that he
                        might truly be called Natures Scholler. His workmanship is especially seene
                        at Acesi, a City of Vmbria, in the Cloisters of S. Francis, where the body
                        of S. Francis lyeth buryed: where among other rare inuentions of his, is to
                        be seene a Monke kneeling before Obedience, who putteth a yoake vpon his
                        necke, he holding vp both his hands to heauen, and shee laying her
                        forefinger vpon her mouth, casteth vp her eyes towards Christ, from whose
                        side the blood issueth in great abundance. On either hand of her, stand
                        wisedome and humilitie, to shew where true obedience is, there is wisedome
                        and humility, which helpe to finish euery good worke: on the other side is
                        an historie where chastity standeth vpon a strong and high rock, as not to
                        be wonne, or moued by the force of kings, though they seeme to offer
                        Crownes, Scepters, and Palmes. At her feete lyeth purity, in the shape of a
                        childe washing it selfe and by chastity standeth pennance, hauing driuen
                        away with her discipline winged Loue: in a third place standeth pouerty
                        barefooted, treading vpon thornes, a dogge barking at her; at one side, a
                        child throwing stones at her, on the other, another child with a sticke
                        putting the thornes towards her legs. This pouerty is marryed to Saint
                        Francis, whom Christ<pb facs="00137" n="121"/>giueth by ioyning their hands:
                        in a fourth place is Saint Francis, praying with such great deuotion, and
                        inward affection expressed in his countenance, that it detaineth the
                        beholder with singular admiration. From thence returning toward Florence, he
                        wrought in distemper (as we call it) or wet with size, sixe histories of
                        patient Iob, wherein are many excellent figures: among others the positures
                        and countenances of the messengers, bringing the sorrowfull newes vnto him,
                        which are not to be mended: withall a seruant, with one hand keeping off the
                        flies from his sore master, and with the other stopping his nose: the
                        countenances and draperies of the standers by done with such grace and
                        iudgement, that the fame hereof presently went ouer all Italy. Insomuch that
                        Pope Benedict sent a messenger from Rome into Tuscany to know what manner of
                        man Giotto was, and what his workes were; beeing purposed to beautifie Saint
                        Peters Church with sacred Histories by the hand of some excellent master.
                        This Messenger or Courtier from the Pope, taking his iourney to Florence,
                        passed by Siena, and still enquiring out the best masters, tooke a draught
                        of something from euery one of them to carry back to the Pope, to choose as
                        he thought best: comming to Florence in a morning betimes, he came to the
                        shop of Giotto, desiring (as he had done of others) to giue him a touch with
                        his pencill, or some peece to shew his Holinesse: Giotto being merily
                        disposed, tooke a sheete of paper, vpon which, with a pencill (setting one
                        arme vnder his side) he drew so absolute a Circle, that by no compasse a
                        truer could be drawne; hauing done, smiling he gaue it to the Courtier,
                        saying, There is my draught. The Courtier imagining hee had flouted him,
                        said, is this all? Giotto replyed, it is all, and more then enough. When the
                        Pope with others of iudgement saw it, and hard the manner how carelesly he
                        didit, he admired and confessed, he passed all men of his time in
                        excellency: this being knowne, it grew a Pro<pb facs="00138" n="122"/>uerbe
                        in Italy, More round then Giotto's Circle. The Pope after this, did him much
                        honour, and very liberally rewarded him. Hee had painted vpon a certaine
                        wall the picture of the Virgin Mary, and when this wall was to be mended,
                        such care by reason of the excellency of his Art) was had of this picture,
                        that it was cut square and taken downe whole out of the wall with a great
                        deale of paine and cost. He made in Mosaique, in the fore court of Saint
                        Peter, the ship wherein Peter and the Apostles were in danger of drowning,
                        their actions and gestures full of feare, the sailes ful of wind, with the
                        behauiour of Fishermen in such extremitie. At Avignon hee wrought for Pope
                        Clement the fift; and in many other places of France his workes are yet
                        remaining. Anno 1316, he was at last sent for by Robert king of Naples, for
                        whom there (in the Church of the Cloyster of Saint Clare) he made many
                        histories both of the old and new Testament, with the whole history of the
                        Reuelation: it is said that herein his inuention was admirable, and that he
                        was much holpen by his deare and ingenious friend Dantes the Poet. The King
                        was not onely pleased with the excellencie of his hand, but with his many
                        wittie answers and conceipts; wherefore sometime he would sit by him halfe a
                        day together to see him worke. Once the King said vnto him, Giotto I will
                        make thee the foremost man of my Court; I beleeue it (quoth Giotto) and that
                        (I thinke) is the reason why I am lodged in the Porters lodge at your Court
                        gate. Another time also the King saide thus vnto him, Giotto if I were as
                        thou, the weather is so exceeding hot, I would giue ouer Painting for a
                        while; whereunto Giotto replyed, Indeed Sir, if I were as you, I would let
                        it rest indeed. Another time, being at worke in the great Hall of the Court,
                        the King merily requested him, to paint him out his kingdome; Giotto made no
                        more adoe, but presently painted an Asse with a Saddle on his backe, and
                        smelling at another new Saddle that lay before him<pb facs="00139" n="123"
                        />at his feete, as if hee had a mind to that, rather then the other vpon his
                        backe; and vpon each saddle a crowne and a Scepter: the King demanded what
                        he meant thereby; Giotto replyed, Such is your Kingdome and Subiects, for
                        they desire new Lords daily. In his returning to Florence, he made very many
                        rare peeces by the way: deuised many excellent Models for building; beside
                        other his workes in Caruing, Plaistique, &amp;c. The Citie of Florence
                        not onely Roially rewarded him, but gaue him and his posteritie a Pension of
                        an hundred crownes a yeare, which was a great summe in those times. </p>

                        and his owne industry, became not onely equalsto his master, but in some
                        respects excelled him, as many of his works doe manifest, namely the Virgin
                        Marie in the Church called Campo Santo at Pisa, which to say truth, excelled
                        that of his Masters in the Cloister of Santo Spirito in Florence. He painted
                        he transfiguration of our blessed Sauiour in the Mount with Moses and Elias,
                        where the light was seene to shine downe vpon the Apostles, who with such a
                        faire action lay so<pb facs="00140" n="124"/>wrapped in their mantles that
                        yee might perceiue all the foldings vpon the ioints, and made the nakednes

                        by Giotto. In another Chappell he made the fall of Lucifer, wherein hee
                        shewed many excellent foreshortnings of bodies, armes, and legges; wherefore
                        by the Artists of his time, he was named Occhio di Natura, rhe eye of

                    <p> Buffalmacco was scholler to Taffi, and as, excellent in his profession, so
                        was he merry and of pleasant conceit: wherefore hee was familiar with Bruno
                        and Calandrino, rare Artists and of his owne humour, many of whose iestes
                        are recorded by Boccace. Buffal macco being a young youth while he dwelt
                        with Taffi, was called vp by his master by two or three of the clocke in
                        winter mornings to his worke, grinding of colours or the like, which grieued
                        him much; and bethinking himselfe how to make his master keepe his bed, he
                        got vp in the fields some thirty or forty Dorres or Beetles, and a little
                        before his master should rise, fastning little waxe candles vpon their

                        his masters chamber; who seeing the lights moouing vp and downe, began to
                        quake for feare, committing himselfe to God with hartie prayer, and couered
                        himselfe ouer head and eares in his bed, hauing no mind to worke or a wake
                        Buffalmacco. In the morning hee asked Buffalmacco if hee had not seene a
                        thousand Diuels as he had; who answered no, for he was asleepe, and wondered
                        he called him not: Called, saide Taffi? I had other things to thinke of then
                        to paint, I am fully resolued to goe dwell in another house. The night
                        following though Buffalmacco had put in but onely three lights into his
                        chamber, yet could he not sleep for feare al that night: it was no sooner
                        day but Taffi left his house with int&#x0113;t neuer to come into it
                        againe. Buffalmacco heereupon went to the priest of the parish to desire his
                        aduice, telling him that in his conscience the Diuell next vnto God hated
                        none more then painters; for that, said Buffalmacco, we make him odious in
                        the peoples eyes by painting him terrible and in the vgliest shape he can
                        deuise; and more to spight him, wee paint nothing but Saints in Churches to
                        make the people more deuout then otherwise they would, wherefore the diuels
                        are very angry with vs, &amp; hauing more power by night then by day,

                        this working by candle-light. This he spake so confidently, and in so demure
                        manner to the priest, that the priest auouched it to be true, and with great
                        reasons perswaded Taffi euer after to keepe his bed; which beeing published
                        about, working by candle-light was left through the towne euer after. The
                        first proofe of his skill he shewed at a Nunnery neere Pisa now wholly
                        ruined, beeing the birth of Christ, where Herod killed the children of

                        come at his pleasure, and was better attended and serued then before. For
                        said Cosmo, The excellence of rare Spirits are heauenly formes, and no
                        burthen-bearing Mules. Many excellent peeces he made in Florence, admired
                        and applauded by the best Matters. At Prato by Florence, where hee was
                        acquainted, the Nunnes of Sancta Margarita procured him to make their high
                        Altar-table, where being at worke, hee espied a beautifull virgin, a
                        Citizens daughter of Florence, whole name was Francisco Bati: This maid was
                        there kept to be made a Nunne; she was most beautifull, her name was
                        Lucretia, &amp; so he wrought with the Nunnes, that he obtained leaue to
                        draw her Picture; but by continuall gazing vpon her countenance, he became
                        so enamoured of her, that what by close messengers and other meanes, he got
                        her out of the Nunnerie: hee got her away and married her, and by her he had
                        a sonne, named also Philip, who became an excellent Painter. This Frier
                        Philips workes are to bee seene at Prato. And amongst other S. Bernard layed
                        out dead his brethren mourning about him, and many Cripples and diseased
                        persons, which (as it was said) with touching the Hearse and his body, were
                        healed. Then hee most excellently wrought the Martyrdome of S. Stephen, the
                        beheading of S. Iohn Baptist, with many others. Hee died aged fiftie seuen,
                        Anno 1438. Hee had a stately Monument of Marble erected ouer him; his
                        Epitaph was written by Angelus Politianus, which for the elegancy I will

                        Naples, which the King had in great admiration, for that they could not be
                        washed out with water: comming to the view of Antonello, Antonello could
                        neuer be in quiet vntill he had found out the Inuentor, whose name was Iohn
                        Van Eyck, who entertained Antonello very curteously, and shewed him his Art
                        what he could; but at last, Iohn Van Eyck dying, Antonello returned vnto
                        Venice, where his workes of the Magnifici were much admired, and for that he
                        brought the working in Oyle the first into Italy; he was honoured with this

                        Verrocchio, Andreas Mantegna of Mantuae, so highly esteemed and honoured of
                        Duke Ludovico Gonzaga; Francesco Francia, Michael Angelo: and will comprise
                        them in the excellencie of one onely Raphaell D'Vrbine, who was borne at
                        Vrbine; whose fathers name was Giovanni de Santi, a Painter also. This
                        Raphaell was brought vp vnder Petro Perusini in Perusia, where hee so gaue
                        his mind from a child vnto Drawing and Painting, that in short time hee
                        contended for the Palme with the greatest Matters of Europe, and was for his
                        admirable inuention, sirnamed the Wonderfull. There was a great aemulation
                        betweene Raphaell and the aforenamed Francesco Francia, who liued and
                        wrought at Bologna, till at the last through meere admiration, by report of
                        each others skill, they grew most louing friends, greeting each either by
                        letters continually; yet had Francia neither seene Raphaell Vrbine, nor any
                        of his workes (by reason he was old and could not trauaile, abiding alwaies
                        in Bologna) vntill it fortuned that Raphael Vrbine hauing made a S. Cicilia
                        in a faire Altar-table, for the Cardinall De Pucci Santi quatro, which was
                        to bee set at Bologna, at S. Giovanni Sopra Monte (or on the Hill); which
                        Table he shut in a Case, and sent it to Francia, as vnto a deare friend,
                        that if any thing were amisse, or it happened to be defaced or iniured in
                        the carriage, hee would amend it: and beside, so much befriend him, as to
                        set it vp in the<pb facs="00149" n="137"/>place appointed, and to see it
                        want nothing fitting. When he vnderstood thus much by Raphaels Letter, hee
                        opened the Case with great ioy, and set the peece in a good and faire light;
                        which when he had throughly viewed, he was so amazed, and grew so out of
                        conceipt of himselfe and his owne worke, confessing his worke to be nothing,
                        in respect of Raphaell Vrbines: which so strucke him to the heart, that he
                        died (presently after he had set the peece in his place) Anno 1518. The fame
                        of Raphaell Vrbine at this time was so great, that hee was sought for and
                        employed by the greatest Princes of Europe, as namely the Popes, Adrian and
                        Leo; Francis the first, King of France; Henry the eight, King of England;
                        the Dukes of Florence, Vrbine, Mantua, and diuers others. Those stately
                        hangings of Arras, containing the History of S. Paul oat of the Acts (then
                        which, eye neuer beheld more absolute Art, and which long since you might

                        State of Venice, where Raphaell Vrbine dyed. I haue no certainty, but suse I

                <p> IT is meete that a Noble or Gentleman who beareth Armes, and is well descended,
                    bee not onely able to blazon his owne proper Coate; deriue by pedegree the
                    descent of his family from the originall, know such matches and allies as are
                    ioyned to him in blood; but also of his Prince, the Nobilitie, and Gentrie where
                    he liueth, which is not of meere ornament, as the most suppose, but diuersly
                    necessary and of great consequence: as had I fortuned to haue liued in those
                        <unclear reason="faded">ime&#x0115B;</unclear>, when that fatall
                    difference of either ROSE was to be decided by the sword; with which partie in
                    aequitie and conscience could I haue sided, had I beene ignorant of the descent
                    and pedegree Royall, and where the right had beene by inheritance of Blood,
                    Match, or Alliance. </p>
                <p>How should we giue Nobilitie her true value, respect, and title, without notice
                    of her Merit: and how may we guesse her merit, without these outward ensignes
                    and badges of Vertue, which anciently haue beene accounted sacred and precious;
                    withall, discerne and know an intruding vpstart, shot vp with the last nights
                    Mushroome, from an ancient descended and deserued Gentleman, whose Grandsires
                    haue had their shares in euery foughten field by the English since Edward the
                    first? or my selfe a Gentleman know mine owne ranke; there being at this instant
                    the world ouer, such a medley (I had almost said Motley) of Coates, such
                    intrusion by adding or diminishing into ancient families and houses; that had
                    there not beene within these few yeares, a iust and commendable<pb facs="00151"

                    these few yeares, see Yeomen as rare in England, as they are in France. </p>
                <p>Besides, it is a contemplation full of pleasing varietie and for the most part,
                    sympathizing with euery Noble and generous disposition, in substance the most
                    refined part of Naturall Philosophie, while it taketh the principles from
                    Geometry, making vse almost of euery seueral square and angle. For these and
                    other reasons, I desire that you would bestow some houres in the study of the
                    lame: for a Gentleman Honorably descended to bee vtterly ignorant herein,
                    argueth in him either a disregard of his owne worth, a weaknesse of conceipt, or
                    indisposition to Armes and Honorable Action; sometime meere Ideotisme, as
                    Signeur Gaulart; a great man of France (and none of the wisest) inuiting on a
                    time many great personages and honourable friends to his Table, at the last
                    seruice a March pane was brought in, which being almost quite eaten, hee
                    bethought himselfe, and said; It was told mee, that mine Armes were brauely set
                    out in Gold and Colours vpon this March-pane, but I haue looked round about it
                    and cannot see them: Your Lordship (said one of his men) eate them vp your selfe
                    but now. What a knaue (quoth Mounsieur Gaulart) art thou? thou diddest not tell
                    me before I eate them, I might haue seen what they had beene. </p>

                    among the ancient Romanes was very great; that same lus Feciale, or Law of
                    Armes, being first instituted by. Ancus Martius, as Liuie testifieth, though
                    some ascribe it to Numa Pompilius, who ordained a Colledge of Heralds. </p>
                <p><note place="margin-right">Dionysius Halicernass. antiquit. Kom. lib. 1.</note>
                    The office of an Herald, was to see that the Romaues made not warre iniustly
                    with any of their confederates; to determine of warre, peace, leagues,
                        agreements,<pb facs="00152" n="140"/>wrongs taken or offered by them or
                    their enemies, and the like. </p>
                <p>Now if the enemy had offered them wrong, or taken away any thing from them by
                    violence, they first sent Messengers to demand their right, and the restoring of
                    that they had taken away; which was done in a solemne forme, and the words
                    pronounced distinctly, and with a loud voyce: and this manner of deliuering
                    their message, was called Clarigatio. The forme was this, Iouem ego testem
                    facio, sinego impiè iniusteque illas res dedier populo Romano mibique exposco,
                    tunc patriae compotem nunquam sinas esse. eIf they refused their demaunds, or to
                    make restitution: first all league and friendship (if any were betwixt them)
                    being renounced and broken, after thirty dayes, (which they solemnly obserued)
                    they proclaimed open warre, and with fire and sword inuaded the enemies
                    Countrey, and by force recouered their owne. </p>
                <p>Neither was it lawfull, for either Consull or Senate, or any of the common
                    people, to take vp Armes against an enemy, without the consent and approbation
                    of the Heralds. </p>
                <p>Amongst the Heralds, there was one the chiefe and aboue <note place="margin-left"

                    whom they called Pater Patratus; and he was chosen one who was to haue children,
                    and his owne father aliue: him, one of the inferior Heralds, crowning his head
                    and Temples with Veruaine, made him the chiefe or King, either in concluding
                    peace, or denouncing warre. </p>

                    denouncing warre, is set downe at large by Liuie. The Tybarens are reported to
                    haue beene so iust in their making warre, and defiance of their enemies that
                    they would neuer meete them, but first they would send them word of the day,
                    place, yea, and very houre they meant to fight. </p>
                <p>Moreouer, if any complaint by the enemy were made<pb facs="00153" n="141"/>of
                    breach of the league, the Heralds examined the truth, and hauing found out the
                    Authors, they deliuered them vp to the enemy to doe with them as he listed: or
                    if any without the consent of the people, Senate and Heraldes, either fought or
                    made peace, entered league, &amp;c. the Romans freede themselues againe, by
                    deliuering vp the Authors to their enemies. So were the Consuls T. Veturius,

                    himselfe, (who made request that himselfe withthe rest, who had offended, might
                    be deliuered to the enemy) <note place="margin-right">Liuius lib. 9</note> are
                    thus recorded by Livie. Dedamur per feciales, nudi vinctique, exolvamus

                <p>The word Blazon is from the French Emblasonner; and note that wee in England vse
                    herein the same tearmes of Art with the French: because the ancients of our
                    Nobilitie for the greater part, acknowledge themselues to be descended out of
                    Normandy, and to haue come in with the Conquerour, many retaining their ancient
                    French names, &amp; Charges vnto this day; as Beauchamp, Beaumont, Sacuill,
                    Neuill, with many others. </p>
                <p>Your A. B. C. in this Aart, let be the knowledge of the sundry formes of Shieldes
                    or Escotcheons which are, and haue beene ordinarily borne in the ancient times.
                    Among nations wee of Europe haue onely two kinds in vse (the Lozenge excepted)
                    viz. that we vse in England, France, Germany, &amp;c. and the Ouall they
                    beare in Italy; which forme they yet (for the old Roman) hold in vse. </p>
                <p>The word Escotcheon is deriued from the French un escù, that from the Latine
                    Scutum, and that againe from <gap reason="omitted"/> in Greeke, which is
                    leather; because the ancients had their Shieldes of tanned leather, the skinnes

                <p>The shield in times past was had in such honour, that he wholost or alienated the

                <p>Bitter was that ieast of Scipio, when he saw a souldier bestow great cost in

                <p>Armes of Ensignes at the first had their chiefe vse for distinction of Tribe from

                    without the mixture of one of these, the other as too darke of themselues could
                    not be discerned farre, neither of White and yealow onely, as participating too
                    much of the light. Hence they say (though not generally true) where there is
                    wanting colour or mettal, it is false armorie. </p>
                <p>I will not stand here to dispute ouer-philosophically,<pb facs="00157" n="145"
                    />as some haue done, of the praeheminence of one colour aboue another, or out of
                    profound ignorance affirme blacke to be the most ancient colour, because
                    darkenesse was vpon the face of the earth in the Chaos; as if colour were not,
                    qualitas visibilis luminis beneficio, and priuatio were for marum susceptibilis;
                    and white the next, because God sayd fiat Lux; as if light were a qualitie
                    resulting of an elementary composition, it being created before all mixe bodies:
                    yea with Aristotle I rather affirme blacke properly to bee no colour at all, as
                    partaking of <note place="margin-right">Arist. in lib. <gap reason="omitted"

                    />, of the Elements mingled together, as earth, water, aire, not yet reduced to
                    their proper substance, as we may see in charcoales, all bodies consuming but
                    not consumed, whereupon it is called Niger, of the Greeke <gap reason="omitted"
                    />, which signifieth dead, as a colour proper to dead thinges. The colours, to
                    say truth, immediately proceeding from the Elemenfs, are yellow and white:
                    yellow being an effect of the fire and all heate (as wee may see in gold)
                    begotten by the heat, of the Sunne, by the mixture of the clearest and most pure
                    quicke-siluer, and the finest red brimstone, in fruite and corne ripened by the
                    heate of the same, in choller, vrine, lie boyled, the bellies of hot venemous
                    Serpents and the like. The white is proper to the water and earth, as we may see
                    in all watery bodies congealed; as Ice, Snow, Christal, Glasse, pretious stones
                    beaten into powder: also the most rootes, the pulpe of apples, peares, and the
                    like of watry substance, of earth in the ashes of woode and stones burned, all
                    which turne white, being by the fire purged from water &amp; aire.
                    Concerning the aire it selfe, it hath no colour at all. </p>
                <p>Now after your two Mettals, yellow and white, Gold or Siluer, which in Armory we
                    cal Or &amp; Argent: you haue foure principall colours, viz. Sable or

                <p>From simple colours and diuision by bare lines, they came to giue their charges
                    quicke and liuing things, such as sorted best with their fancies and humours,

                    a Beare; the Romanes gaue the Eagle, which euery Legion seuerally bare. The
                    reason whereof <note place="margin-left">Iosephus li. 3</note> Iosephus giueth,

                    their ensignes were of Siluer, because that mettall was most sutable to the day
                    light, and was to be discerned farther: so Portius Latro telleth Catiline of his
                    siluer Eagle borne before him as the ensigne of his rebellion and furie. Besides
                    the Eagle, the Romanes vsed to beare in their banners the <note

                    aduanced the Minotaure in their standards, to shew that the counsaile of

                    and seruiceable in the warre, being full of furie, and desirous of victorie; and
                    in the Ides of Decembers Horse was sacrificed to him who had broken the right
                    wing of his enemies battaile: Lastly, they bare a Hogge in their ensignes,
                    because the warre being finished, they vsed to make a truce by sacrificing a

                    <p>The last and least obseruation is of Crests, the Helmet, the Mantle, and
                        doubling therof, which according to the manner of diuers Countries, are
                        diuersly borne. In Germany they beare their Beauers open with Barres, which
                        we allow in England to none vnder the degree of a Baron: in some places they

                        Conquerour presently after the Conquest, made Hugh Lupus the first Earle
                        Palatine of Chester, to hold the said whole County of him, ita libere ad
                        gladium sicut ipse Rex tenebat Angliam ad Coronam. And the said Earle Hugh,

                        vnder him, (as the learned Camden saith) eight Barons, they all being his
                        trustie friends; whereof the principallest was Nigell his cosen, whom he
                        created Baron of Haulton: and for the valiant courage and boldnesse which
                        Earle Hugh had often experienced to be in the man, hee ordained him also
                        Constable of Chester, an office of speciall trust, as in whom is reposed the
                        charge and guiding of all the souldiours, horses, Armor, and other prouision

                <p> I Now from your priuate studie and contemplation, bring you abroad into the open
                    fields, for exercise of your Body, by some honest recreation, since Aristotle
                    requireth the same in the Education of Nobilitie and all youth, since the mind
                    from the Ability of the <note place="margin-left">In L. Solon ff. de Alea lusu

                    the Civill Law these kinds of Exercises were onely all lowed of, that is, <gap
                        reason="omitted"/> and <gap reason="omitted"/>, which are the exercise of
                    Armes by single combate, as running at Tilt-barrians, &amp;c. coiting,
                    throwing the hammer, sledge, and such like, Running, iumping, leaping, and
                    lastly wrestling: for the first, it is the most Noble, those <note

                        reason="omitted"/> and <gap reason="omitted"/>, haue beene the attributes of
                    Kings and Princes, whose delight in au ncient times was to ride and mannage
                    great horses. Hereby you are ennabled for command, and the seruice of your
                    Countrey. And what, saith Tullie, can be more glorious, then to bee able to
                    preserue and succour our Country, when she hath neede of our helpe? It is the
                    onely Commendation that Salust giues Iugurth who did not (saith he) giue
                    himselse ouer to be corrupted by Sloath and Riot (as many of our Gallants now
                    day es doe) but as it is the custome of that Nation, exercised himselfe by
                    riding, throwing the dart, and running with his equals: and though he excelled
                    all other in the height of glory, not withslan ding he was held deare and
                    beloued of all men, &amp;c. And Caesar vsed the exercise of riding so much,
                    and hereby be came so actiue and Skilful, that laying his hands behind him, he
                    would put his horse to his ful carreer, make him on the suddaine take hedge or
                    ditch, &amp; stop him, put him into a ring, and the like. And Marius after
                    he had beene seauen times Consul, and fourescore yeeres of<pb facs="00199"
                        n="187"/>age, exercised himselfe daily in the field of Mars with the Roman
                    youth, instructing them to handle their weap&#x014D;, to ride, &amp;c.
                    The like also did Pompey euen to his ast expedition. And Virgil speaking (I take
                    it) of the Spartan youth, saith: </p>
                <p>Venatu invigilant pueri, Sylvasque fatigant,<lb/> Flectere Iudis equos, &amp;
                    spicula tendere cornu, &amp;c. </p>
                <p>And at this day it is the onely exercise of the Italian Nobility, especially in
                    Naples, as also of the French; and great pitty of no more practised among our
                    English Gentry. </p>

                    French King, with many other princes and noble personages of whom Historie is

                    Emperour of Constantinople, as saith Nicetas, who wrote about the yeare 1214.
                    before his time wee read not any where that this exercise was vsed vnder the
                    Roman Empire. </p>
                <p>The same Nicetas reporteth of solemne Iustes or Torneaments which the said Manuil
                    Comnenus showed vnto the Lataines at Antioch, what time they went to make warre
                    in the holy land: for the Latines making a braue shew in their rich Armour well
                    horsed, with their Lances, and presenting themselues before the Emperor; the
                    Emperor to shew them that the Graecians were nothing inferiour vnto them in
                    brauery or courage, appointed a day when they and the Latines (for the glory of
                    either Empire) should so many to so many, and with lances without points,
                    encounter eyther, brauly mo&#x016B;ted and made one of the number with his
                    Caecians; who, saith Nicetas, so brauely carryed himselfe, that he vnhor<pb

                <p>In our launces now adayes (of what wood soeuer they are made of) there is nothing
                    so much danger as hath beene in times past: neither in our moderne practise of
                    warre haue they almost any vse at all. The Prince of Orange hath a bandoned
                    them, hauing not a Launce in his whole Armie, but hath Carbines in their roome.
                    Spinola hath some troopes of them, yet not many, as I obserued. Those of
                    Shertogen bosch vnder Grobbendoncke, are esteemed the best horse Spinola hath. </p>

                    throwing &amp; wrestling, I hold them exercises not so well beseeming
                    Nobilitie, but rather Souldiers in a Campe, or a Princes guard: neither haue I
                    read or heard of any Prince or Generall commended for wrestling, saue
                    Epaminendas Achmat, the last Grand Signeur &amp; Emperor of Turkie, who
                    tooke great delight in throwing the Hammer, and was so strong that he ouerthrew
                    his stoutest Ianizaries, there being reared in Constantinople for one
                    extraordinary cast which none could come neere, two great Pillars of marble. </p>
                <p><note place="margin-left">Of running.</note> Running and Agility of Body haue
                    beene esteemed most commendable in the greatest Princes and Commanders that euer
                    liued; and the old Romans (next after trial made of their strength, and view of
                    their limmes and person) chose their souldiers by running, for it was an old
                    custome among them, to assault the enemy by running all close together in grosse
                    to the charge. And Caesar tells vs that strokes are surer laid on, and the
                    souldiers <note place="margin-left">C. Caesar in Epistolis.</note> made more
                    nimble and ready in running and by motion. Homer gaue Achilles (which perhaps

                    like inuious places; in somuch as Metellus beeing sent with a powerfull Armie
                    against him, he knew neither where to find him, nor how to come by him, by
                    reason of his nimble footmanship. Thereupon he sent his Colleague Pompey, who
                    beeing by Sextorius ouerthrowne at the first encounter, escaped very narrowly;
                    for beeing vnhorsed, and hauing receiued a great wound, while the souldiers were
                    busied in striuing, some for his horse, others for the most rich furniture (his
                    caparison, bridle, saddle, stirrops, being in a manner al of gold, and shining
                    with pretious stones of inestimable valew) watching his opportunity, by swiftnes
                    of foot escaped from them al, and returned safe to his quartter. </p>
                <p><note place="margin-right">Of leaping.</note> Leaping is an exercise very
                    commendable, and healthfull for the body, especially if you vse it in the
                    morning, as we read Alexander and Epaminondas did. Vpon a full stomack or to
                    bedward, it is very dangerous, &amp; in no wise to be exercised. </p>
                <p><note place="margin-right">Of swimming.</note> The skill and art of swimming is
                    also very requisite in euery Noble and Gentleman, especially if he looketh for

                    vpon infinite occasions,) he may many waies annoy his enemie. Horatius Cocles
                    onely by the benefit of swimming saued his country, for when himselfe alone had
                    long defended and made good the <note place="margin-right">Liv. lib. 2. Decad.

                    down behind him, wherewith, in his armour he cast himself into the Riuer,
                    &amp; (not withst&#x0101;ding a shower of darts &amp; arrowes were
                    sent after him) swam with safety into the city, which rewarded him with a statue
                    erected in the market place, and as much land as he could encompasse with a
                    plough in a day. </p>
                <p>And as desperate was the attempt of a number of Romane Gentlemen in the first
                    Carthaginian warre, who leaping in a night from the hatches of their ships
                        into<pb facs="00202" n="190"/>the sea, by maine force thrust and drew the

                    Instruments, the sides of the Spanish Gallions, and returned backe safe to the
                    fleete. </p>

                    double Armes and an heauy shield, cast himselfe in to the deepe, and swam safe
                    to Caesar and his fleete </p>
                <p>Neitheris it to be wondered at, that the were so Skilful in swimming, for they
                    were daily exercised in the same after their other exercises, &amp; had a

                    to the field of Mars; and a nother of great depth, rough and full of whirlpits
                    on purpose, to exercise their horses in. </p>

                    all other was most iniustly dealt withall. If they had taken away twelue and

                    but as Cuckoes in the Spring, one time in the yeare to the Countrey and their

                    of Carriage, and care of our Reputation, without which our most gracefull gifts
                    are dead and dul, as the Diamond without his foile: for hereupon as on the
                    frontispice of a magnificent Pallace, are fixed the eies of all passengers, and
                    hereby the heigth of our Iudgements (euen our selues) is taken; according <note
                        place="margin-left">Ecclesiastic.</note> to that of the wiseman, By gate,
                    laughter, and apparrell, a man is knowne what he is, Wherefore I call it the
                    crowne of good parts, and loadstone of regard. The principall meanes to preserue
                    it, is Temperance and that Moderation of the minde, wherewith as a bridle we
                    curbe and break our ranke &amp; vnruly Passions, keeping as the Caspian Sea,
                    our selues euer at one heigth without ebbe or refluxe. And albeit true it is
                    that Galen saith, we are commonly beholden for the disposition of our minds, to
                    the Temperature of our bodies, yet much <unclear reason="illegible"
                    >lyeth</unclear> in our power to keepe that fount from empoisoning, by taking
                    heed to our selues; and as good Cardinall Poele once said, to correct the
                    malignitie of our Starres, with a second birth. For certainly vnder grace it is
                    the roote of our Reputation and honest Fame; without the which, as one saith, we
                    are dead long before we are buryed. </p>
                <p>For Moderation of the minde and affections, which is<pb facs="00207" n="195"/>the
                    Ground of all Honestie, I must giue you that prime receipt the kingly prophet
                    doth to a yong man, teaching him wherwith to cleans his way, that is, by
                    keeping, saith hee (oh Lord) thy statutes, meaning the feare of God in generall,
                    without which (hee euer first striking at the <note place="margin-right">Psal.

                    are not able to giue any thing his true esteeme and value. Therefore first to be
                    truly Honest is to bee truly Religious, for if the feare of men be a great
                    motiue to keep our selues within compasse, much more will the feare of God,
                    recall vs from our lusts &amp; intemperance. Hereby the mind getteth the
                    dominion and vpperhand, wisely gouerning that goodly kingdome Nature hath
                    allotted her. And if it was sometime said of Fabius, Citiús Sol&#x0113; é
                    sua sphaera diuelli, quam Fabium ab honestate potuisse, how heedfully ought a

                    Heathen could goe so directly in the darke, onely by the glimpse of Nature, and
                    without stumbling? </p>

                    you shall withall finde good Learning and the Arts to conferre a great help and

                    and a curer of many diseases our minds are subiect vnto: for we learne not to
                    begge to our selues admiration from other, or boastingly to lay to view so rich
                    and pretious furniture of our minds, but that we may bevsefull to others, but
                    first to our selues; least (as some pretions receipt) while we keepe that in a

                    endeauours, so say I now, of all vice and basenes if regard be not had.
                    Therefore hold friendship and acquaintance with few, and those I could wish your

                    delight in popularity, and are pliable to companykeeping, but many times buy
                    their acquaintance at ouer deare a rate, by being drawne either into base
                    Actions and Places of which they are ashamed for euer after; or to needless

                    Gentleman, as the care of his whole Estate, and preseruation of his name and
                    posteritie; yet as greatly wanting in many, as they come short of the reputation
                    and entire Estates of their forefathers, who account thrift the obiect of the
                    plow or shoppe, too base and vnworthy their consideration, while they impose
                    their faire Estates and most important businesse, vpon a cheating Steward, or
                    crastie Bailiffe, who in few yeares (like the young Cuckow) are ready to deuoure
                    their feeder; and themselues like sleepy Pilots, hauing no eye to the compasse,

                <p> I Will conclude with Trauaile, which many disallow in Gentlemen, yea and some

                    &amp; confirmeth more the iudgment of a Gentleman in forraine affaires,
                    teacheth him knowledge of himselfe, and setleth his affection more sure to his

                    other, then to be learned and wise? and where may wisdome be had, but from many
                    men, &amp; in many places? Herevpon we finde the most eminent and wise men
                    of the world to haue beene the greatest Trauailers (to omit the Patriarches and
                    Apostles themselues in holy writ) as Plato, Pythagoras, Aristotle, Theophrastus,
                    Osyris, King of AEgypt, who trauelled a great part of the world, and caused to

                    voyage) he built a Citie in the forme of a Persian shield. And it was the vsuall

                    seene Thebes hauing an hundred gates, and at euery gate two hundred horse-men
                    for the guard. But say some, sew of our Gentlemen are bettered by their
                    trauaile, but rather returne home worse then they went in manners, and many
                    times in Religion, therefore it were betrer they tarried still at home;
                    according to Claudian: </p>
                <p>Foelix qui patrijs aevum transegit inagris,<lb/> Ipsa domus puerum quem videt
                    ipsa senem:<lb/> Quibaculo nitens, in qua reptauit arena,<lb/> Vnius numerat
                    Saecula longa casae. </p>
                <p>Hee's blest who in's owne Country ends his daies,<lb/> Whose homestead see's his
                    old age and his birth, &amp;c. </p>
                <p>But this happinesse is but puerorum beatitudo, as one saith; and the greatest
                    vnhappinesse to the truly generous and industrious minde. </p>
                <p>If therefore you intend to trauell, you must first propound vnto your selfe; the
                    End, which either is ad voluptatem vel ad vtilitatem; pleasure or profit. For
                    the first, euery one naturally affecteth, and the foole himfelfe is tickled with
                    the sight of strange, townes, towers and habits of people. Therefore you must
                    hold you to the other which is profit, which againe hath two branches, your owne
                    priuate, or thr publique; your priuate, as the recouery of your health, by some
                    outlandish meanes, as the water of the Spaw, some Phisition famous for his cure
                    in such &amp; such kinds, chang of aire, or gaining as a Merchant by
                    trafique, or some profession wherin you excell others. The publique is the
                    generall good of your Coun<pb facs="00223" n="211"/>trey, for which we are all
                    borne, it challenging a third part of vs. </p>
                <p>But before you trauaile into a strange Countrey, I with you (as I haue
                    herertoofore said) to be wel acquainted with your owne; for I know it by
                    experience, that many of our yong gallants, haue gone ouer with an intent to
                    passe by nothing vnseene, or what might bee knowne in ther places; when they
                    haue beene most ignorant here in their owne natiue countrey, &amp; strangers
                    to their iust reproofe could discourse, anb say more of England then they. </p>
                <p>In your passag, I must giue you in either hand a light, Preseruation, and
                    Obseruation. Preseruation of your minde, from Errors, and ill manners; of your

                    Master. For as heere in England, so in other places, the language is spoken with
                    more elegancy &amp; purity in some places more then others. For the French,
                    Orleans and there about is esteemed the best, Florence for the Italian, Lipsick

                <p>Now as well for neighbourhod sake, as that the French tongue is chiefly affected
                    among our Nobility, it being a copious and a sweete language, wherein so many

                <p>You shall find the French, I meane of the noblest and better sort, generally free

                    some of which (as breathing on a faire hill) I will detaine you a while. And
                    first we will begin <note place="margin-left">The Lovure,</note> with the Lovure
                    in Paris. The Lovure is the royall seate of the kings of France, famous
                    throughout al Europe, situate neere to the towne walles on the West side: by
                    which runneth the riuer of Seine, which in old time serued rather for a
                    fortresse then a Kings house, and herein was a tower wherein were kept the kings
                    reuenues and treasure. Which after by King Francis the first, was pulled downe,
                    and in this place was begun the building of the front, which is of Masonry, so
                    enriched with pillars, frizes, architraues and all sort of architecture with
                    such excellent symmetry and beauty, that throughout all Europe, you shall hardly
                    find the like. It was begunne by Francis the first, finished by Henry his sonne,
                    vnder the appointment of the Lord of Clagny, and afterwards en creased by
                    Francis the second, Charles the 9. Last of all made the wonder of all other,
                    workes by that beautisull Gallery, the worke of Henry the 4. </p>

                    a place wherein they made tiles, and by reason there were many faire Gardens
                    about it, the Queene mother drawing the plot her selfe, seeing it a pleasant and
                    fit place, began first to build here. It is a roinll worke all of free stone.

                    build, tooke great pleasure in this seate &amp; builded here the house, as
                    we see it at this present; the<pb facs="00227" n="215"/>base Court hereof is
                    esteemed the fairest of all France; in the second Court there is the purest and
                    fairest fountainc esteemed in the world, wherefore it was called Belle eauë, and
                    so Fontaine Belle eauë. R. Francis loued this place so well, that he spent most
                    of his time here, beautifying it while hee liued with all forts of commodities,
                    goodly galleries, Stroues, &amp;c. and caused the rarest Masters of Europe
                    in painting to besent for, for the beautifying it with all manner of Histories.
                    Also heere he placed the rarest Antiquities he could get. In briefe, whatsoeuer
                    he could wrap or wring, he thought to little for this place; it is about
                    fourteene leagues from Paris. </p>

                    a great way off both by the hill, and the vally yeelding so goodly a prospect,

                    set Masons a worke, the rather because it adioyned vnto the greatest forrest of
                    all France, himselfe louing hunting exceedingly. Here are the goodliest walkes

                    mountaines about, which is the Forrest of Lyons: among those Mountaines are many

                    &amp; of admirable Art: it was begun by Charles County of Valois, brother to
                    Philip the faire, and finished a goodwhile after by Charles the fift. This house
                    hath many faire Courts in it, withall about it a Parke, containing in circuite
